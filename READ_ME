Pre Lab:
    Linear Search:
        this can be used for sorted or unsorted arrays. You look thorugh every item of a list to find
        if the value exisits. O(n).
    Binary Search:
        Can only be used for a sorted array. Finds the middle of the array and if the value there
        is greater than the target value than is performs the same process but with only that half of
        the array. This continues until the value is found or until the array is size of one which means
        the value is not present in the array.
    Question: The worst case time complexity of binarys earch ocurrs when a value is not found. The time
        complexity for this senario is O(log2(n)). This is beacue each time a middle value is checked
        the array's size is halved.
